# Brewery App READ ME _PLEASE_

So! I didn't finish. I've never said I am a fast coder, and I have a long long precedent of taking a long time to do (otherwise) good work.

The backend is, AFAIK, solid and fully fleshed-out. If you follow the routes, which I am happy to demonstrate if you like, it will return the data necessary to populate the frontend (were the frontend ready). 

That's where it ends, unfortunately. A user can log in via the FE but nothing else. Not even the profile info is displayed properly, because I ran out of time.

Again, I am happy to demo the backend in case you don't have the time to trudge through the routes & models, so please let me know.
